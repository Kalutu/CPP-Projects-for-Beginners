# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple command-line based implementation of the popular game, Rock Paper Scissors, written in C++.

## Getting Started
To play the game, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. If you don't have a C++ compiler already installed, you can download one for your operating system:
- Visual Studio
- GCC for Linux
- Xcode for Mac
Once you have a C++ compiler installed, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine.

## How to Play
- To play the game, navigate to the directory where the game is installed and open a command prompt or terminal window. Then, compile and run the game.
- You will be prompted to enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will then randomly generate its own choice, and the program will determine the winner based on the game's rules.
