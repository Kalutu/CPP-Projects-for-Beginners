# Simple File Encryption/Decryption
This is a simple console-based program that can encrypt or decrypt a text file using a basic encryption algorithm. It prompts the user to enter a file name and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the file.

## Features
- Encrypt File: Takes a text file as input and encrypts its contents using a basic encryption algorithm.
- Decrypt File: Takes an encrypted text file as input and decrypts its contents to recover the original text.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code files.
3. Compile the source code using the C++ compiler of your choice.
4. Run the compiled executable file.

## Usage
Upon running the program, follow the on-screen prompts to use the file encryption/decryption program:

1. Enter the name of the file: Provide the name of the text file you want to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Select the operation:
   - 1: Encrypt File
   - 2: Decrypt File
3. The program will perform the selected operation on the file and create a new file with the encrypted or decrypted contents.

Note: The encrypted file will have the "encrypted_" prefix, and the decrypted file will have the "decrypted_" prefix followed by the original file name.
