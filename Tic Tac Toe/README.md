# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The game board is represented by a one-dimensional array, and players take turns entering their moves (X or O) until one player wins or the board is completely filled (tie).

## Installation
- To run this game, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one already, you can install GCC for Linux, or Visual Studio for Windows.
- Once you have a C++ compiler installed, download or clone this repository to your local machine:
- Navigate to the project directory:
- Compile the source code.

## Usage
- To start the game, run the compiled executable file.
- Follow the prompts to enter your moves (1-9) when prompted. 
- The game board will be displayed after each move, and the game will end when a player wins or the board is completely filled.
